# Flight Fight
this is the official github repo for the best VR flying-FPS game in the whole entire world

## How to test it for yourself
1. clone the repo
2. export it somewhere safe
3. open godot
4. import the project file
5. learn how to export to apk or _(better option)_ stream the game using PCVR

OR

1. download the latest apk from the releases tab  

FYI it's probably not signed or something, idk I hate android app dev  

## Why I open-sourced this
Open source is great + I'm not that good at VR game dev 💀  
Also technically this isn't my game, I'm recreating it based off some of [this guy's](https://www.tiktok.com/@allegoryxr) older vids (he's the original dev).  
I used to be one of the head mods of the game when it was still running, which is why I'm trying to bring it back to life. That and everyone wants the game back
